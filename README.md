Project's purpose is documenting process of learning Data Science and AI related technologies such as: 
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tensorflow
* PyTorch

It can also serve as sort of cheat sheet if I want a refresher on how things work

To learn Numpy I used materials provided by `GormAnalysis`  
Especially challenges I implemented are his ideas
